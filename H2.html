                    As a result of the evolution of the different segments of the system, during 2011 the population covered by some health insurance reached 64.2% of the total, exhibiting an increasing trend as of 2004.<br>
                    Coverage in rural areas exceeds coverage in urban areas; in the former it reaches 78.4% of the population, in 2011, while in the latter, it reaches 61.8%.

In 6 of the 25 regions, the sanitation indicator reaches values above 90.0%, with Callao being the region with the highest relative value (96.8%), while the lowest values are observed in Ucayali, Pasco and Loreto, with rates of access to sanitation services of 39.7%; 55.4% and 55.9%, respectively.<sup>[28]</sup>

                    Up to now, one of the main strategies proposed by the state to reduce anemia was to carry out campaigns, with which it was hoped to reduce the prevalence to 19% by 2021; however, these did not exceed 15 thousand sieves which demonstrated the limited scope of this method as it was approached. However, this changed when a mega campaign was held on October 29, 2017, which was presented as a "cultural link", in which all of MINSA's resources were mobilized: more than 600 health care posts were built at the national level, located in the square, parks, markets, among other places of recurrence; health personnel came out with megaphones to summon people; Stalls were installed, not only for screening and delivery of medicines, but also for nutritional tasting and counseling, and even for festive activities. Telemanagement was used for the first time, connecting at the same time to the 25 regional health directorates and managements, but each one, with its particular strategy of meeting with its population, whether it is brigadistas, health establishments open on holidays or health care tents. All this led to an unprecedented achievement, more than 154,000 children and pregnant women screened at the national level.<sup>[26]</sup>

                    Iron deficiency can be prevented by dietary modifications, fortification of food and supplementation with nutritional iron. The ideal way to prevent iron deficiency is through an adequate diet, which is not always possible to achieve due to economic limitations or deep-rooted habits.<sup>[23]</sup><br>
                    Similarly, related studies affirm the existence of a direct relationship between the socioeconomic stratum and the prevalence of iron deficiency<sup>[24]</sup>, for this reason we conclude that populations with fewer economic resources are considered to be at risk for the presence of iron deficiency.<sup>[25]</sup>

                    Food availability can be defined as safe and permanent access to a sufficient and adequate level of nutritious and safe food that meets the food needs of all family members throughout the year. There is a direct correlation between a sufficient and varied diet and the state of nutrition and health of the family members. Different experiences show that when the person does not consume the necessary quantity and quality of food, it is difficult to fight the diseases even when there are efficient health services and a healthy environment.

                    An inadequate and unbalanced diet is not always the result of a shortage of food or lack of money to buy it; It can also be related to the ignorance of the family about the principles of good nutrition and nutrition. The major causes of death, illness and disability in which diet and nutrition play an important role include coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, atherosclerosis, obesity, some forms of cancer, Type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, dental caries, gall bladder disease, dementia and nutritional anemias (iron deficency and megaloblastic). Iron deficiency has been pointed out as the most frequent cause of anemia in the world. The ignorance of the value and proper ways of eating some foods, as well as the inherited taboos, cause that some families do not have a consistent and rational attitude towards various foods of great nutritional value and thus hinder the development of eating habits that promote optimal and healthy nutrition. The main results of a study conducted in our country showed that peruvians manifest high levels of ignorance and lack of information on nutrition issues. In addition, it was observed that, in view of this generalized ignorance, peruvians show great interest in receiving nutritional information.

According to the project manager, the role that the NGO played was to train, strengthen and facilitate the articulation between the local authorities and the population. To active they goal, they proceed with the following line of action:

                The last plan that will be analyze are the Strategies to prevent Anaemia: Recommendations from an Expert Group Consultant [7], which were elaborated to provide policy, technical and operational recommendations on strategies to reduce anemia, and to identify research need in the South-East Asia region. In this context, is worth noting that this plan was specifically selected because of its validity and the similarities in the anemia prevalence with the peruvian communities, in terms of sanitation, population, access to health care and, the anemia index.Synthesizing, the lines of action propose by the South-East Asia Regional Office are the following frameworks about prevention.

                        In the last report we define the problem as the effects of anemia but we didn't define the cause. Now we can redefine our problema integratean the main cause we identify that is the lack of monitoring.
